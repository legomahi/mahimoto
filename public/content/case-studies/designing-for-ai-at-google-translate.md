lead: "Since 2014, I've had the privilege of leading UX for Google Translate — one of the most beloved Google products. I was drawn to its mission of breaking language barriers and creating opportunity through access. Over the course of a decade, I've helped shape that mission into strategy, scaled a multi-disciplinary UX org, and guided the product through two major AI inflection points — first with Neural Machine Translation (NMT), and later with Large Language Models (LLMs)."

## Impact

During my tenure, Google Translate has grown from 600M to over 2B monthly active users, maintaining over 85% market share globally in an industry rife with user choice. But growth hasn't just come from usage of our core Translate apps. It has also required finding new use-cases and pursuing a new strategy that followed opportunities outside of our own surfaces. 

## Navigating the LLM shift

Google Translate has long been a showcase for machine learning. But the rise of Large Language Models posed an unprecedented challenge: suddenly, translation no longer required building and optimizing translation models. LLMs can translate out of the box, and everyone with access to an LLM had a translator in their pocket.

We had to respond — quickly and strategically.

## Ways of working

**Rapid Prototyping:** I partnered with engineering leadership to spin up a focused tiger team and build early working LLM prototypes. This gave us real intuition about what types of problems we could solve with LLMs and facilitated alignment at a time when everything felt uncertain

**Grounding in User Insight:** While many products were pivoting to LLM-based chat UIs, we paused to listen. Our UXR team ran large-scale surveys to understand what users valued most. The results were clear: people loved Translate for its speed and simplicity. That clarity gave us conviction. We kept our core UI lightweight, while layering in powerful new capabilities that solved real user needs — like Translation Insights and personalization — powered by LLMs.

**Finding New Use Cases:** Because LLMs could replicate basic translations, we looked for differentiating ways of solving translation-related problens — and found them in language learning. We had long known that language learners made up a large portion of our audience, and LLMs were uniquely suited to help them. We began investing in learning-focused features that aligned with our mission and gave us strategic lift.

##  Leading with Insight

When I joined, our core Translate products were well-instrumented — we could see what users were doing, but lacked insights into why. Over time, I've built and scaled a global research practice that shaped both product and organizational strategy.

**Global brand tracking:** I sponsored and launched our team's first longitudinal brand measurement survey across 11 key markets to understand our position and perception relative to competitors. The results revealed hidden gaps in market penetration and brand strength — helping shape our "Translations Everywhere" strategy (more on this later.)

**Foundational UXR in High-Priority Regions:** I insisted on immersive international research — first with vendor partners, later with our growing in-house UXR team. These insights grounded our roadmaps and helped us make the case for everything from new features to organizational growth.

##  Growing a mature product

Google Translate was already a category leader when I joined. One of my core challenges was finding a path to growth in a product that already served most of the addressable market. The answer came through innovation, partnerships, and a long-term view on quality.

I've always believed that innovation needs space and structure. Each year, I've carved out dedicated time for team-wide sprints where we explore bold ideas outside the constraints of quarterly roadmaps. Many of our most impactful features started in these offsites.

I've also welcomed collaboration — across functions, across orgs, and even from unconventional sources. Some of our most successful launches came from partnerships with external teams. I never saw that as a threat to ownership. Good ideas deserve a path forward, wherever they come from. 

That mindset — creating space for ideas and staying open to collaboration — translated into real, industry-shaping product work. We've focused on solving real user problems and continuously raising the bar. For example:

**Tap to Translate:** Inspired by behavioral research, this feature let users translate text from any app without switching. We partnered with Google's Creative Lab to bring it to life — and competitors soon followed.

**Gender-Specific Translations:** To address bias in translation models, we became the first platform to offer gender alternatives when translating into gendered languages. This became a new norm across the industry.

**Elevating the Craft:** Early on, Translate was built for speed, not polish. I believed we didn't have to choose. Over time, we've modernized all major surfaces — mobile, web, and more — and shifted the team culture toward one that values product excellence.

## Expanding Impact: "Translations Everywhere"

Innovating in our apps allowed us to sustain our leading market share. To drive real growth, I championed a bold strategy: bringing translation to rest of Google. At the time, Translate was only visible in Search and Chrome. We changed that.

**Pitch to Jeff Dean, Our SVP at the time :** I co-led our pitch and narrative, showing how broader integration could drive user value and strategic differentiation. It resulted in the biggest team expansion since Translate's inception.

**Strategic Integrations:** We've prioritized impact over volume. One major bet: bringing native translation to Pixel phones — making them the first to offer OS-level, out-of-the-box translation. Post-launch surveys confirmed it drove a meaningful lift in Pixel NPS.

Another: integrating Translate into Google Assistant. Our pitch led to the creation of a dedicated translation vertical within the Assistant org, unlocking new voice-powered translation experiences.

**Scale through Empowerment:** To scale beyond what our team could directly support, I sponsored the creation of Google-wide UX standards and toolkits for translation. This enabled dozens of teams — from Workspace to Android OS — to implement high-quality translation experiences without starting from scratch.

## Looking Back

Leading UX for Google Translate has been the experience of a lifetime. I'm grateful for getting to build a multi-disciplinary global UX team spanning design, research, motion, content, and UX engineering. I've helped shape a product that serves over two billion people, stays at the forefront of AI, and remains true to its mission while also evolving as the world around us is changing.
I'm also grateful for the people I've worked with, the problems we got to solve, and the chance to help push the future of translation forward — one user, one sentence, one barrier at a time.
