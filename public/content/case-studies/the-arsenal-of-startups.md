lead: "I love Arsenal. Not because they win a lot of trophies (they don't), but because of their belief in "the Arsenal way," a philosophy that can be summarized as: always doing the right thing. In 2013, I had the privilege to work at Litmus as Head of Design. Looking back at my time there, I'm still struck by their deeply-rooted culture of respect, authenticity and a genuine drive for excellence that made them the Arsenal of startups. "

## A most productive year 

In a span of a year, with the help of an amazing team I completely redesigned and relaunched the Litmus tool that was the heart of the business, and rebranded all of our marketing pages; blog, monthly newsletters, and still had time to design and ship two experimental products. As the only designer I did all of the end-to-end interaction and visual design work for all products, taking them from wireframes to full html prototypes and occasionally tweaking shipped front-end code. 

## Redesigning Litmus

Litmus is an online tool for email marketers and designers. Among other things, it helps them make sure their email is delivered and rendered properly in all email clients and devices. It is an indispensable part of the daily workflow for many marketers and designers who cannot imagine their life without it. As such, I had to be careful about change aversion.

The tool was originally designed by Paul, Litmus' CEO who is himself a designer. It already worked great, but was starting to show its age. I kept most of the core user journeys intact, while designing a new navigation framework to help users find the right tools faster and easier. I also simplified common settings. But the biggest impact came from an entirely new design system that doubled-down on craft and improved cohesion across product and marketing surfaces.

## Beyond the basics

In addition to the visual redesign, I also worked on new features and products. One of them was a landing-page link checker. I used the user's designed email as a base and overlaid it with indicators that displayed erroneous links for a scannable UI.

Beyond UI design, I prototyped feautes in code, helping front-end developers implement designs easier – these were the days before Sketch and Figma! I often tweaked styles and markup on our production code after the initial check-in by engineers, freeing their time from having to wrangle with layout or style definitions.

We launched the new design in a matter of months. The reaction was overwhelmingly positive. Our twitter buzzed for days with enthusiastic tweets from our users who loved the changes.

## Product meets marketing

Like the main tool, Litmus' marketing pages hadn't been updated since the product was first launched. I decided to update all of the marketing pages, extending the design system I had created for the product. The design system was based on combining flat design with subtle details, reflecing Litmus' obsession with customer success. I also worked with our CEO to define and shape the messaging for the features we wanted to highlight and market.

When all was said and done, I had designed and hand-coded 30 different marketing pages. Most of the sub-sections incorporated some sort of subtle scroll-based animation which I implemented using CSS and javascript. Most of the code I wrote was used in production.

## A NEW BLOG

The Litmus blog was an important part of the company's communications and marketing strategy. It was updated regularly with thought-leading content that had many subscribers. Since we had multiple authors, the blog visuals lacked consistency. I wanted all of our users' interactions and experiences with Litmus to feel consistently polished, whether it was in the product or on the blog. 

Again, I leveraged the new design system. To make the blog more glancable, I showed snippets of posts on the blog home, and introduced optional cover images for posts. This design better suited our frequent pace of publishing, allowing visitors to skim through all the newly published articles in a visually engaging way, before deciding which ones to read in full. The result was another success. I also hired a full-time communications designer to create all of our blog assets and post cover images using a consistent visual style.

## Newsletters

Email newsletters were another important part of Litmus' relationship with its customers and the email marketing community at large. While at Litmus, I designed, illustrated, and coded all of our monthly email newsletters. I incorporated the same branding elements I used on our marketing pages. Thanks to their great content, these newsletter consistently received high open and click rates, and were frequently showcased in email design galleries and websites.

## And a few other things

In addition to working on Litmus, I also worked on other experimental side products that got shipped. One of them was the Litmus Scope, a plugin that allows you to capture and share any email you see right from your inbox, and easily look at the html code behind the email.
