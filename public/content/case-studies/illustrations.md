## Google Doodles

I was asked to draw the Google Doodles for Nowruz, the Persian new Year, in 2025 and 2024. The Persian new year coincides with the first day of spring. I had a lot of fun illustrating these, and sharing this ancient holiday with the world. I also illustrated the doodle celerating Elizabeth Hastings, disability advocate in Australia.

## Shahs of Legend

In 2024, I published my first pair of children's books. What had started as a single book I wanted to make for my son, turned into a best-selling children's book about the characters of a 1000-year-old epic called the Book of Kings. I sold 1,000 copies in less than 3 months.

## Riso and screen printing

At Google I was fortunate to have access to the HIVE print space, where I learned the art of screen printing and fiddled around with the Risograph.
